# Ethical Hacker project
 There was event called KrakYourNet... Recently I've been beginning a new chapter in that adventure with Cisco NetAcad.
 - these first two tools I created during IT lab on my university.
 - with 't-o-c-1.py' you can take over control over network devices(obviously you had to gain admin data like username or password)
 
Legal Note:
Version with Nmap is usually passive and legal, but you should still have permission from the owner of the host being scanned or 
the appropriate network permissions.

- with 'port-scanner.py' you could receive response from hosts through ports which you will type. I tried to, in the time on university,
implemented it in Java[additionaly I'd like to present data on chart, but I couldn't fix it, because there was't, i.e.ChatGPT]
